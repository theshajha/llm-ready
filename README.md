# LLM Ready - Convert internet pages into LLM readable markdown data 
This project was inspired by me trying to create a digital clone for me that can learn to think and write like me. Idea is to build an engine that can take any content from the internet and convert it to LLM readable markdown data, including social media profiles and content (though this might be tricky to do).
